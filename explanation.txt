How many minutes are in 80 seconds? Two and a half hours? How many hours are in a quarter of a day? The answer to these questions is 1.33 minutes, 150 minutes, and 6 hours. Let me ask another question, what is 1.33 minutes? We don’t say that…ever. We say 00:01:20. 

This is confusing. Why can’t things work like the metric system? Can 80 seconds be .08 minutes, two and a half hours be something like 250 minutes and a quarter of a day look like 250 somethings? Yes, all you have to do is convert seconds.

In the standard system for time, we don’t do this. Instead, each day is split into 24 hours, which are referred to either as 24 hours or as two separate 12 hour periods, you choose. Each of those hours is split into 12 parts, right? Wrong. Each hour is split into 60 minutes, then each minute into 60 seconds. So is each second split into 60 something elses? Nope. Don’t get me wrong, 24,12,and 60 are all great numbers for usability. That’s how we ended up with this system. What I’m saying is, we can do better than this. 

So can we just make a day a straight number of seconds? Well yes, but it’s not pretty. A day is 86,400 seconds long. So how long is a quarter of a day? 21,600 seconds. That’s not very human readable. Luckily, there's an easy way to change how that number looks. Just like converting from Imperial to Metric is as simple as multiplying by a factor, so is converting our current system of time into something that resembles metric. All you have to do is convert seconds.

Let’s make a system in base 10 like most of our numbers. Okay how many divisions do we want? These will act as hours, minutes, and seconds, but we might call them something else and there might be more or less divisions than 3. Let’s say 4 divisions. If we can only count up to 9,999, then I guess that makes 1 day 10,000 seconds long. The problem here is that a day is not 10,000 seconds, it’s 86,400. But as I said, we just have to convert seconds. If we divide 10,000 by 86,400, we now know how many standard seconds there are in one of these new seconds. We'll call them seconds(10) and seconds(O). O as in Original. But if we do this, 1 second(10) is now about 8.64 seconds(O). Granted we can make it 0.864 seconds(O) by just changing the number of divisions to 5. Then a day is 100,000 seconds(10) long.

Call the divisions whatever you like. For example, 10^0 is seconds(10), 10^1 is decaseconds(10), 10^2 is hextoseconds(10), 10^3 is kiloseconds(10), and there are 100 kiloseconds in a day.

It really just comes down to picking a base you like and a number of divisions you like. I personally like base 16 with 4 digits, because I think 4 digits is quite readable and I think hexadecimal is fantastic.

I like to call this system for time Continuous Positional Time, because it is positional and continuous, unlike standard time which is not continuous since it skips from 1 number to another using a conversion factor like 60. You might call it Metric time, but that already exists.
